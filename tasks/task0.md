Task 0: Rules for workshop
=============================

- Tell me if I am going to fast
- Ask anything - there is no stupid questions
- We will use YAML for: api configuration, validation, routing
- We will use XML for: mapping models
- We will use Annotations for: serialization/deserialization groups
- You will code a lot, don't worry there is solution for every step
- Ask anything that is not clear for you - there is no stupid question (it is not mistake, just ask if you need help)
- Please provide me feedback at the end, I will appreciate it
